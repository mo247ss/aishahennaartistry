            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Aisha. Iâ€™m 19 years old and have been passionately creating intricate henna designs for the past three years. But my love for henna art began much earlier, in the cozy confines of my childhood bedroom, where I would spend hours drawing flowers and patterns on paper. I was always mesmerized by the beauty and elegance of henna, and dreamed of bringing my drawings to life.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I would watch my mother and grandmother adorn their hands with beautiful henna designs during festive occasions. The joy and pride they felt when displaying their henna was infectious. This inspired me to start experimenting with henna cones myself. What began as a hobby soon turned into a full-blown passion. I found that henna was not just a form of art, but a way to tell stories, celebrate traditions, and bring happiness to others.</p>
            <p>In the last three years, I have honed my skills, transforming my passion into a professional service. Every design I create is unique, crafted with love and attention to detail. I specialize in bridal henna, festival designs, and casual henna art, ensuring that each piece is a perfect blend of tradition and personal style.</p>
            <p>My journey from doodling in my bedroom to becoming a sought-after henna artist has been incredibly fulfilling. The smiles and satisfaction of my clients are my greatest reward. I am dedicated to making every henna experience special and unforgettable.</p>
